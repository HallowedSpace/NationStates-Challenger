# NationStates AutoChallenger
This is a script i made in 10 minutes to automatically do the challenges against other nations in [NationStates](https://www.nationstates.net/)

## Installation
i recommend tampermonkey so go [HERE](https://www.tampermonkey.net/index.php?locale=en) to install that.
Then in the extension, add a new userscript and copy and paste all of the text from [HERE](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HallowedSpace/NationStates-Challenger/main/script.js) into the editor (make sure before pasting all of the comments at the top are gone before you copy paste).
Then go in the top-left, press file, and save. Then go to [HERE](https://www.nationstates.net/page=challenge/matchmaker=1) to begin and it will automatically start challenging. 
## Note for the technologically intermediate or higher
(if you arent a skid then feel free to change and make pr here if you make it better because it is lazy and could be optimized)
