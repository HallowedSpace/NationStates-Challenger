# NationStates AutoChallenger
This is a script i made in 10 minutes to automatically do the challenges against other nations in [NationStates](https://www.nationstates.net/)

## Installation
i recommend tampermonkey so go [HERE](https://www.tampermonkey.net/index.php?locale=en) to install that.
Then in the extension, press add a new userscript <img src="https://github.com/HallowedSpace/NationStates-Challenger/blob/main/createscript.png">

copy and paste all of the code from [HERE](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HallowedSpace/NationStates-Challenger/main/script.js) into the editor (make sure before pasting all of the comments at the top are gone before you copy paste).
